  This project is an application that interacts with the Unsplash API.
 
  ## How to Run This Project
  1. **Obtain an Unsplash API Key:**  
     - Visit [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers) and register for a developer account.
     - Create a new application to obtain your unique API access key.
 
  2. **Create a `.env` File:**  
     - In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env`.
     - Add your Unsplash API key to this file in the following format:
       ```
       UNSPLASH_API_KEY=your_access_key_here
       ```
 
  3. **Install Dependencies:**  
     - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all required dependencies.
 
  4. **Start the Project:**  
     - Use `npm start`, `yarn start`, or the appropriate command for your environment to run the project.
 
  ## Note
  - Ensure that your `.env` file is **not** committed to version control to keep your API key secure.
  - The application will not function correctly without a valid Unsplash API key.
